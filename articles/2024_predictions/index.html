With limited direct investment avenues in stocks, AI coins play an increasing role in the speculative mania as more tradfi dollars find their way into the crypto ecosystem with the bitcoin and then ETH ETFs as the first stop to pump liquidity in. The FORT index (FIL OLAS RNDR TAO) is retired as hundreds of legit new crypto AI projects launch.\nFriend Tech‚Äôs not dead, socialfi is here to stay, and FT points go to $1. Whether or not FT pulls it off, their combined innovation of privvy account abstraction and progressive web apps have shown that non crypto natives can easily sign up for crypto apps.

We get a decent selloff in Q1, followed by chop into election. First half of the year is for accumulation; Even with chop, activity on-chain stays elevated and ‚ÄúETH as yield bearing asset‚Äù becomes the main narrative that feeds into TradFi to coincide with ETH ETF approval. ETH outperforms BTC and SOL second half of the year; Optimism stack gains further popularity and at least one superchain becomes a staple crypto product.
